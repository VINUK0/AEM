# AEM (Adaptive Expert Models) — Abstract

## [Overview]

- *Let’s talk about how to build an LLM that doesn’t have to activate every single one of its 90-billion neurons to say “I don’t have human emotions” when you ask it, “how are you doing?”*

- *I introduce the architectural concept for a memory-efficient and fast modular neural network that uses a light-weight* ***`Intent-Router`*** *that analyzes the* ***`embedding_vectors`*** *for semantic meaning and dynamically selects a* ***`subset of layers to be activated and loaded into memory `*** *thus drastically reducing memory overhead while giving latency a much-needed diet plan.*

*To maximize efficiency and personalization, the system incorporates:*
- **Cached Intent-Maps**: *Frequently seen prompts are mapped to known expert-layer paths.*
- **User-Specific Preference Caches**: *Over time, the system learns which domain layers a given user hits most often and pre-emptively loads them to reduce latency.*

---

**But wait — what if the input has *Multiple-Intents*?**  
*Will the model start hallucinating ASCII art and legal advice in the same sentence, like you gave the main chef role to an intern?*

*To handle this, I propose always activating* **2–5 Generalized Layers** — *a foundational safety net with broad semantic coverage. These ensure that:*
- *The model remains coherent even when routing confidence is low and doesn't all of a sudden turn into a GPT-2 level of intellect.*
- *Secondary or ambiguous intents are still acknowledged and processed gracefully, at least I hope that will work out this way.*

---

*Further sections will rip into:*

- **Training expert-specialized layer groups** *on domain-specific datasets.*
- **Intent router design**, *including caching logic and fallback strategies.*
- **Efficiency benchmarks** *and expected trade-offs in memory, latency, and versatility.*

## [Routing Model]

- *At its core, the routing system is a lightweight* ***`Intent Classification Model`*** but instead of working with basic* ***`tokenized text`***, *it takes in high-dimensional* ***`embedding_vectors`*** *as input. Why? Because we're aiming for* ***`semantic understanding`***, not string-matching.*

- *The router outputs a set of* ***`intent-classifications`***, *each with an associated* ***`confidence-score`***. *These are then used to determine which grouped-layers or individual expert-layers should be activated for the prompt.*

- *If multiple intents are detected, we route to the **highest-confidence expert set**, while fallback or residual understanding is absorbed by the always-on Generalized Layers.*

- *Crucially, the router must be trained* ***`on the full dataset used to train the LLM itself`***, *or at the very least, a sufficiently representative distribution of it. This avoids routing blind spots and ensures the model doesn’t send “legal advice” queries to the “culinary tips” layers unless you're into spicy lawsuits.*


[LLM Training]

- *You will need to group the LLM's available layers into categories where they will specialize in and manually train those layers on datasets that only contain the domain-specific knowledge.*

- *For the Generalized Layers, add a fairly decent amount of everything, what use a safety if it breaks under a bit of pressure.*

- *Remember to use quality data, instead of large quantities of low-quality information.*

[FAQ]

1: What is the basis for this existing?
- I got the initial idea from partial fine-tuning that was popular back in the days, and LoRa adapters. And probably from the idea of some platforms automatically routing user inputs to different LLMs based on the input.

2: How practical is this?
- I would say fairly practical and could even be implemented in a few weeks, since everything discussed here already exists; except this model for some reason.

3: Why don't you create it then?
- I can barely stop wondering about new ideas to write this, and I don't have the resources either.
